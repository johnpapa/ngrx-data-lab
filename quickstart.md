# QuickStart

This quick start begins with a working angular app that has CRUD operations for heroes and villain entities. This app uses traditional services and techniques to get and save the heroes and villains. In this quick start you will add NgRx and ngrx-data to the app.

> What are we doing? Great question! We're going to start with a reactive Angular app and add ngrx to it, using the ngrx-data library.

## Let's go!

Here are the steps to add ngrx-data to your reactive angular app, in a nutshell:

1.  Open your reactive Angular app
2.  npm install the NgRx libraries
3.  Create the NgRx store
4.  Tell the store about your entities
5.  Refactor the data services to use NgRx
6.  Run it!

### Step 1 - Get the app and install ngrx

This sample app shows and allows editing of heroes and villains. The app uses a traditional data service to get the heroes and villains. Well be adding ngrx and ngrx-data to this application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnpapa/ngrx-data-lab.git
cd ngrx-data-lab
npm install
npm i @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity @ngrx/store @ngrx/store-devtools ngrx-data --save
```

### Step 2 - Create the NgRx App Store

We start by creating the NgRx store module for our application. Execute the following code to generate the module and import it into our root NgModule.

```bash
ng g m store/app-store --flat -m app
```

We must import the NgRx store, effects, and (for development only) the dev tools. To do this, replace the contents of `app-store.module.ts` with the following code.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { EffectsModule } from '@ngrx/effects';
import { StoreDevtoolsModule } from '@ngrx/store-devtools';
import { environment } from '../../environments/environment';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot({}),
    EffectsModule.forRoot([]),
    environment.production ? [] : StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument()
  ]
})
export class AppStoreModule {}
```

### Step 3 - Define the entities for our store

We have a root store for NgRx named `app-store.modules.ts`. NgRx allows us to create features, and our ngrx-data entity cache is a feature. Next we create the entity store for ngrx-data and tell the Angular CLI to import it into our app-store module.

```bash
ng g m store/entity-store --flat -m store/app-store
```

We need to tell ngrx-data about our entities. We create an `EntityMetadataMap` and any custom pluralization of our entities. We create a constant of type `EntityMetadataMap` and define a set of properties, one for each entity name. We also define how to pluralize our entities, for those not simply needing an 's' appended to them (e.g. Hero --> Heroes).

> We have two entities: Hero and Villain. As you might imagine, we add one line of code for every additional entity. That's it!

Replace the code in the `entity-store.modules.ts` with the following code.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { EntityMetadataMap, NgrxDataModule } from 'ngrx-data';

export const entityMetadata: EntityMetadataMap = {
  Hero: {},
  Villain: {}
};

// because the plural of "hero" is not "heros"
export const pluralNames = { Hero: 'Heroes' };

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgrxDataModule.forRoot({
      entityMetadata: entityMetadata,
      pluralNames: pluralNames
    })
  ]
})
export class EntityStoreModule {}
```

### Step 4 - Simplify the Hero and Villain data services

Our application gets heroes and villains via Http from `hero.service.ts` and `villain.service.ts`, respectively. ngrx-data handles getting and saving our data (e.g. CRUD techniques) for us, if we ask it to.

Replace the contents of `heroes/hero.service.ts` with the following code.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { EntityServiceBase, EntityServiceFactory } from 'ngrx-data';

import { Hero } from '../core';

@Injectable()
export class HeroService extends EntityServiceBase<Hero> {
  constructor(entityServiceFactory: EntityServiceFactory) {
    super('Hero', entityServiceFactory);
  }
}
```

Replace the contents of `villains/villain.service.ts` with the following code.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { EntityServiceBase, EntityServiceFactory } from 'ngrx-data';

import { Villain } from '../core';

@Injectable()
export class VillainService extends EntityServiceBase<Villain> {
  constructor(entityServiceFactory: EntityServiceFactory) {
    super('Villain', entityServiceFactory);
  }
}
```

### Step 5 - Remove unused service

You may be wondering what happened to `reactive-data.service.ts`. It is no longer needed since our app is using ngrx-data! So we can remove this file from our app and remove the reference to it in `core/index.ts`.

### Step 6 - Run it

Run the app!

```bash
ng serve -o
```

## What we did

In retrospect, here are the changes we made to our app to add NgRx via the ngrx-data library.

* installed our dependencies
* added these files `store/app-store.module.ts` and `store/entity-store.module.ts`
* told NgRx and ngrx-data about our entities
* refactored and simplified our data services `heroes/hero.service.ts` and `villains/villain.service.ts`
* removed obsolete  `core/reactive-data.service.ts`

## What we accomplished

OK, but why? Why did we do this? Why should I care? This is a great question!

We just added the redux pattern to our app and configured it for two entities. Your app may have dozens or even hundreds of entities. Now imagine what you would need to do to support all of those entities with this pattern. With ngrx-data you add a single line of code to `store/entity-store.module.ts` for each entity and that's it! You heard that right, one line!

ngrx-data provides all commonly used selectors, actions, action creators, reducers, and effects out of the box.

It is only natural that our apps may not follow the exact conventions that ngrx-data uses. That's OK! If your entity needs a different reducer or effect, you can replace those via configuration. If your web API url doesn't follow the pattern `/api/heroes`, that's OK! Just override the convention with your own configuration. All of the custom tweaks that you want are available to you when you need them.
